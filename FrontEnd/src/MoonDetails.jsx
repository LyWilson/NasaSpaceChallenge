                    <p>
                        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} /> 
                        The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, 
                        formed around 4.5 billion years ago, likely 
                        due to a massive collision between Earth and 
                        a Mars-sized body, often called Theia. The Moon 
                        is roughly one-quarter the size of Earth and 
                        has a surface area comparable to the size of Africa. 
                        It orbits Earth at an average distance of about 384,400 km, 
                        and is tidally locked, meaning the same side always faces Earth.
                    </p>
                    <b> Orbital Speed</b>
                    <p>
                        The Moon moves around Earth at an average orbital 
                        speed of 1.022 km/s (or 3,683 km/h), completing one orbit 
                        in about 27.3 days. Its rotational period matches its orbital 
                        period, which is why we only see one side of the Moon from Earth.
                    </p>
                    <b> Particularities </b>
                    <p>
                        Moonquakes: Seismic activity on the Moon, known as moonquakes, was 
                        first detected by seismometers placed by the Apollo missions. These 
                        quakes are much weaker than earthquakes, but they can last for up to 
                        an hour due to the Moonâ€™s lack of water and its rigid structure, which
                         allows seismic waves to travel longer distances without being absorbed.
